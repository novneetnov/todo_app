# TODO APP: A Simple App to keep track of Daily Todo Needs

Heroku Link: https://todoapptrack.herokuapp.com/

This week I built a very simple todo-app for daily usage. Focus was mainly on structure & styling. Not many additional gems were used.  

Additional libraries &  gems and resources used:  
1. [Google font: Lato](https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Lato:400,300,700')  
2. [Font-Awesome](https://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/)
