1. [Mackenzie's 12-in-12 challenge](https://mackenziechild.me/12-in-12/)

This week I built a very simple todo-app for daily usage. Focus was mainly on structure & styling. Not many additional gems were used.  

Additional libraries &  gems and resources used:  
1. [Google font: Lato](https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Lato:400,300,700')  
2. [Font-Awesome](https://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/)
